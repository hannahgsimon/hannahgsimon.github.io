    <h2>Note for Graders</h2>
    <p> Note to whoever views this work in progress: just want to say how grateful I am that I decided to participate in the 
      GCA program. In all of my coursework, I never learned how to make websites. Never coded in HTML or CSS before. I'm learning so much!
    However, there is a huge gap underneath all horizontal rules that I can't figure out how to get rid of, any ideas how?
    And any other feedback on this site so far?</p>
